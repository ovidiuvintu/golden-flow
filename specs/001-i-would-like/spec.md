## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure) ‚Äî keep this spec implementation-agnostic
- üë• Written for project stakeholders and engineers preparing the plan

### Section Requirements
- Mandatory sections are included below.

### For AI Generation
1. Mark clarifications needed (if any) with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an operator or developer, I want a simulation dashboard that streams synthetic
telemetry for volumes, concentrations, flow rates, pressures, and temperatures so I
can validate downstream visualizations, alerting, and integration with monitoring tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the simulator is initialized, when the operator clicks Start, then the system
   begins emitting a time-series stream of simulated values (volume, concentration,
   rate, pressure, temperature) at the configured cadence, and the dashboard shows
   live-updating charts and current values.
2. Given the simulation is running, when the operator clicks Pause, then the stream
   halts and the dashboard stops updating but preserves the current buffered view.
3. Given the simulation is paused or stopped, when the operator clicks Start again,
   then the stream resumes from newly generated data (not necessarily from prior state).
4. Given the operator adjusts control inputs (e.g., mean flow rate, noise level), when
   the change is applied, then subsequent simulated values reflect the new parameters.

### Edge Cases
- Very high cadence (e.g., 1000 samples/sec) may overwhelm frontend rendering ‚Äî the
  system MUST document supported cadences and fallback/downsampling strategy.
- If a consumer connection drops, the simulation SHOULD continue running on the server
  side unless explicitly stopped.
- Invalid control values (negative flow rates where nonsensical) MUST be rejected by the
  control UI with validation messages.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST produce simulated time-series for the following metrics:
  volume, concentration, flow rate, pressure, temperature.
- **FR-002**: System MUST expose controls to Start, Pause, and Stop the simulation.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow the operator to configure at least: sample cadence,
  base values (means), and noise parameters (stdev or percent noise) for each metric.
- **FR-004**: The dashboard MUST display live-updating numeric readouts and time-series
  charts for each metric, updating at a reasonable UI cadence (configurable; default 1s).
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a lightweight programmatic stream endpoint (e.g.,
  WebSocket or Server-Sent Events) or a clearly documented local streaming API that
  emits JSON payloads containing timestamp and values for each metric.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST validate user-supplied control inputs and provide clear
  error feedback in the dashboard; negative or out-of-range values must be rejected.
- **FR-007**: No user authentication is required for this feature (explicit requirement).

*Clarifications / Non-functional Requirements*
- **NFR-001**: Default cadence is 1 sample/sec; supported cadences SHOULD include
  faster rates but MUST document performance/load trade-offs. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: max
  cadence required?]
- **NFR-002**: Logging and observability MUST be included per project constitution: the
  simulator should emit structured logs for start/stop/pause actions and errors.
- **NFR-003**: Data retention: streaming data is ephemeral; persisted storage is NOT
  required by default unless a plan requests an export feature. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: any
  persistent export required?]

### Key Entities
- **SimulationSession**: id, status (running/paused/stopped), config (cadence, means,
  noise), startedAt, stoppedAt
- **MetricSample**: timestamp, metricName, value, unit
- **ControlCommand**: command (start/pause/stop), parameters, issuedBy (if applicable)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
