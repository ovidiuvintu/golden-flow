# Implementation Plan: Data Streaming Simulator

**Branch**: `001-i-would-like` | **Date**: 2025-10-05 | **Spec**: C:\Development\golden-flow-oct-05\golden-flow\specs\001-i-would-like\spec.md

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detected stack: Next.js 15 (app router, route handlers, server actions), React 19,
     TypeScript; server-side logic in `src/server`; localStorage for client persistence.
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → data-model.md, contracts, quickstart.md, agent-specific file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md) — note: we will create tasks.md here per user request
9. STOP - Ready for implementation (tasks.md created)

## Summary
Minimal streaming simulator and dashboard supporting: volume, concentration, flow rate,
pressure, and temperature streams; controls: Start, Pause, Stop; configurable cadence
and noise. Stream endpoint via SSE (Route Handler) with server-side simulator in
`src/server`. Persistence: localStorage for client settings; optional export task
available.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Node runtime used by Next.js 15)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15, React 19, (testing: vitest / playwright or Jest + Playwright)  
**Storage**: localStorage for client persistence; ephemeral server-side in-memory session; optional file export (CSV) via client download  
**Testing**: unit tests (vitest), contract tests for stream schema (supertest + Node test harness), integration tests (Playwright for UI)  
**Target Platform**: Local development, modern browsers for dashboard  
**Performance Goals**: Support up to 1000 samples/sec at server-side emit rate (batching + backpressure). Recommended dashboard rendering default 10 samples/sec without downsampling.  
**Constraints**: No auth. Keep server-side logic under `src/server`. Prefer SSE route handler for simplicity and wide browser support; plan allows WebSocket if later needed.  

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Gates (per constitution):
- Test-First: This plan includes contract tests for the stream schema and failing UI/integration tests before implementation.
- Observability: Plan tasks include structured logging for start/stop/pause actions and errors; add a metric for emitted samples/sec.
- Versioning: This is an internal feature; no public API version bump required. If the stream endpoint is consumed externally, document versioning in contracts.
- Accessibility & Performance: Frontend tasks include basic accessibility acceptance (ARIA, keyboard) and performance budget (rendering default 10 samples/sec; plan for client downsampling).

## Phase 0: Outline & Research (research.md)
- Resolve protocol choice: SSE vs WebSocket → choose SSE for initial implementation (simpler route handler, good for uni-directional streaming).  
- Decide server simulator design: single in-memory engine per SimulationSession with batching, configurable cadence, and noise generator.  
- Downsampling strategy: server batching + client throttling; provide raw payloads but recommend sampling for chart library (e.g., downsample to 10/s default).  

Output: `research.md` (see file)

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
1. Data model → `data-model.md` (entities: SimulationSession, MetricSample, ControlCommand)  
2. Contracts → `contracts/stream-schema.md` (JSON schema for emitted objects)  
3. Quickstart → `quickstart.md` (run locally, open dashboard)  

Output: `data-model.md`, `contracts/stream-schema.md`, `quickstart.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
- TDD ordering: write failing contract tests and failing UI integration tests (Playwright) first.  
- Tasks will be created in `tasks.md` with explicit file paths and [P] markers where parallelizable.

## Complexity Tracking
- High cadence (1000/s) increases server memory/CPU; plan includes batching and optional downsampling to mitigate.  

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (this plan includes research decisions)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (data model + contract sketched)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (`tasks.md` created)
